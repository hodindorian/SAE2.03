# SAE2.03

This project is quite special. Indeed, it is executable only on the computer in the Computer Science building of the IUT of Clermont-Ferrand, because it uses a network in particular created thanks to the VDN software. These scripts are used to configure certain machine of the given network by configuring all the configuration files of the machine.
To run scripts, you just have to launch the sae.sh script, which automatically launches all the other scripts.
With the scripts, you have reports on various services that I installed at the same time as the configuration of the machines. There is an explanatory note to explain what the service is for and a file that explains how to install it.
